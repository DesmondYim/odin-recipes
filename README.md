# odin-recipes
Following the HTML lesson from The Odin Project to create a recipe
webpage. 

In this project, I will demonstrate my knowledge in
creating an HTML boilerplate, use of HTML element and tags, 
working with text, creating lists, and adding images and links on
the webpage. 

The end results of this project should demonstrate a firm grasp on
the basics of HTML.
